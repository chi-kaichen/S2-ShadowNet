# Weakly Supervised Shadow Removal Benchmark (WSSR)
Download WSSR from Baidu Cloud: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1VSIDz9n0LVWJum6ulP5wSw?pwd=1004 key: 1004

WSSR provides 1000 shadow images with 4K resolution and corresponding shadow masks.
In addition, we captured non-consistent shadow-free images, which can be used for the implementation of unsupervised shadow removal methods.

Notably, we cropped 1000 shadow images into 4000 patches for training and testing.
In the link, we provide 4K resolution version, which makes it easy for users to adjust the sample size and number by themselves.
